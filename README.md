The problem states that default wind speed for coat is 25 kmph and the temperature resistance of the coat is 45Â° F.

We have to devise a solution so that the wearer can calculate if he/she should wear a coat or not.

There are two conditions: OR & AND. 

In the OR condition the wearer only needs one statment TRUE that is the temperature is either less or the wind speed is higher.

In the AND condition the wearer needs both the statements to be TRUE that is the temperature is less and the wind speed is higher.
